    <h1 class="center">Design Process of Escape Rooms</h1> 
        <h4>
            <p>
                The design process of an escape room is one of the most  important topics
                when it comes to making an escape room. It's what will make or  break your
                escape room and the flow of it. Understanding the design process  will not
                only save you time and money but will take your room design from  mediocre
                to amazing and is one of the many skills you must master before  attempting
                to make your first room. 
                <br>
                <br>So, what is the design process?
            </p>

            <p>
                The design process is a  process that gives
                a proper workflow to design anything from problem to  solution. There are
                many different design process workflows but today I'll be  going over the
                one that works best for me. This process may not be the best for  you, some
                people may want more or less steps, and that's okay. But having a  process
                in the long run will save you time, money, and brain power. The design
                process I use has the following steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Ask
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Research
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Imagine
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Plan
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Create
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Test
            </p>
            <p>
                -           Improve
            </p>
            <p>
                Each step moves closer to your end product. What does each  step mean
                though? Let's dive deeper into each step.

                            Design Process - TeachEngineering</a>) In escape room design this is
                            whatever your  main objective is. You should never go into a room design
                            with just a genre or  theme, you need to have an objective. Whether this is
                            a story line, a  technological idea you want to have be your room's
                            centerpiece, or even as  simple as the room environment. You need to have an
                            idea you can design around.  Also, if you are a designer working for a
                            customer, this is where you need to  find out what the constraints on the
                            project are. From financial, to  installation. What is the customers vision.

                            In the research step we research our project,  this is the phase
                            you will spend most of your time on. This is where you  research your idea,
                            this can be in a range of mood boards, reading literature,  watching videos,
                            and in the case of design, researching if what you are doing  is possible,
                            this step needs to be extremely thorough as not researching enough  can add
                            delays in your project.

                            this, take your ideas you generated in the research step, and  delve deeply
                            into them seeing if it's possible to create what you see in your  head. This
                            can be from finding out if you should use spray foam to make your  rock
                            formations, or hand carve them. Whether using LED light strips is best for
                            you, or DMX lights. Find out what approach you want to take, as none are
                            universal, and each one has pros and cons.

                                ask yourself, which of these solutions is the best for
                                <strong>

                                . And I emphasize the importance of “My Project”. Many times, I  have had
                                someone tell me that their solution is better. And it could be, but  when
                                creating something do what is best for you. Whether it is cheaper, you're
                                more comfortable with said solution, or you want to learn something new.
                                There  is no correct answer in escape room design as in the end its personal
                                preference.  For example, in escape room automation, some companies have
                                chosen to use PLCs  (Programmable Logic Controllers) as they know how to
                                program them, even though  they can be pricey. Some companies choose to use
                                a server rack (such as what I  use in my
                                <em>

                                openly available knowledge about  them. And some companies might not
                                automate anything and leave it to the game  guide running the room. All are
                                great options, each with their own pros and  cons.

                            I like to call this phase the prototyping phase  instead of the
                            create phase, as this is where you will make your first  prototype. Take
                            every bit of information you got from the last steps and put it  into a
                            functioning prototype. This can be from your puzzles, to set design, to
                            your tech in the room. Everything needs to be prototyped.

                            waste  your time and money making a final product, as most of the time, the
                            first  iteration will not be what you desire.

                            most important of them all when it comes to your game flow and  puzzle
                            design. Get people to play test your games, evaluate their gameplay, and
                            ask them questions. I will go more into this step in a later blog post, but
                            I  like to do the following when playtesting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1.       Observe - Observe the behavior of your players,  how are they
                            reacting to the environment around them. What are they doing you  weren't
                            expecting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.       Notate - Take notes, always bring a pen and  paper or something
                            equivalent to your play tests. Take notes of things the  players do wrong,
                            what they do right, what you can improve on, and what needs  fixed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.       Ask - When the players are done ask them  questions, what did they
                            like, what did they dislike. At the end of the day,  your puzzle might be
                            perfect, but if no one likes it then why should you use  it.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Improve</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Improve : This step will never be finished, you can get what  you want, but
                            you will never finish any room. You will always think it needs  something
                            new, or something needs to be done better. At the end of the day  nothing is
                            perfect. But we can always do our best to improve our end product.  Take
                            your tests, improve the room based on them, and repeat.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
            <p>
                Another thing is the design process is not linear. You will  go back and
                forth between each step multiple times, and that's not wrong at  all.
                Another thing is that the design process takes time, don't expect it to
                happen overnight, it can take days, weeks, months, even years to get to your
                final product. And even then, something will always need to be improved
                upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is anything you take back from this, I want it to  be this. Have
                fun when creating something, do stuff you are comfortable with,  and don't
                be afraid to try new things. We design rooms not because of the  financial
                income they bring (though that is a plus), but we do this because we  enjoy
                designing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Work hard, stay creative, stay curious.
