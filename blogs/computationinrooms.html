<h1 class="center">Technologically Complex Rooms</h1>
    <p>
        For those of you  who are just getting into escape room design. You can
        sometimes look at the  market and go “where do I begin?” and that is what
        this blog is for. Now, I won’t  be giving a step-by-step tutorial on how
        each of these works. But I will be  giving the basic knowledge that
        hopefully will help you decide on what you need  to research.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are  multiple controller types so let’s break them down first.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, we have  micro controllers. These are chip sets that have a central
        brain (such as the atmega328p)  that can run basic I/O operations. The most
        basic one (and the one I started  with) is the Arduino Uno. The Arduino
        controllers were originally made for  teaching in educational settings but
        have slowly started to span all the way to  industrial technologies. These
        controllers are quite simple. They read incoming  voltage signals (mainly
        high and low inputs) with a couple of ports for analog data  (0 to 255). And
        depending on what they have been programmed to do. Send out high,  low, or
        analog signals based on the information provided. Arduinos can also  output
        serial data to talk to other controllers. Arduinos also come in many  form
        factors. Each with their own pros and cons. You have the Uno, the standard
        size. The micro removes most of the complex features and going for a compact
        form factor. As well as the mega with more I/O inputs and outputs. These
        aren’t  all the form factors, but the major ones. Overtime however, as
        projects become  more complex. Micro controllers just won’t cut it anymore.
        From their low computational  power preventing real time readings. To the
        inability to run complex data sets  such as audio and video. You will
        eventually have to upgrade. And that is where  single board computers come
        in. <br/>
        <br/>
        What is a single board  computer? A single board computer as the name
        implies is a computer made from a  single “board” or PCB (printed circuit
        board). These computers range in  complexity and price but the most common
        of them all is the Raspberry Pi.  Raspberry Pi has been the go-to brand for
        many. This is mainly due to how  opensource the pi is. Although the hardware
        is not opensource, its software ecosystem  and operating system are. This
        has allowed the community to extensively develop  its features. But enough
        chat about how good the pi is (not sponsored). Why use  it over a micro
        controller? Well for starters, single board computers usually  have multiple
        things that micro controllers don’t. They have dedicated RAM, CPU,  and some
        even have a dedicated graphics unit. This allows for complex data
        operations. Another great thing about single board computers is the
        compatibility with off-the-shelf products. With micro controllers, anytime
        you  want to run something on them. You have to make it yourself. From LEDs
        to running  a keyboard. It all must be DIY. With single board computers,
        most of them run  off a basic Linux operating system. This means (almost)
        anything that you use  on your day-to-day computer can run from your single
        board computer. These are  great for running small servers in your escape
        rooms, or a central control  device for less complex rooms. And this is
        where most escape rooms stop. But we  can take this a step further with
        centralized servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is a  centralized server? A centralized server is used for heavy
        computational power  that is beyond the power of any single board computer.
        This can span from  running video game engines (such as unity) to control
        your game. All the way to  audio servers. The main use case for hobbyists
        however is show control. With single  board computers you can run
        pre-rendered videos. These are your mp4 files and  such. But with servers
        you can run videos that change based on your game state.  Imagine you have a
        submarine room. In this room you want your players after  they solve a
        puzzle to be able to “dive” into the sea. You would have your  dedicated
        server running a live software renderer that will loop an “above sea”  video
        until the players “dive” where it would then be able to render the “dive”
        live in action. This usually is synchronized with lighting effects as well
        through some sort of DMX control (will be discussed in a later blog). Show
        control can really immerse your players, with its only downside being the
        cost  and complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this is  where your hobbyist normally stops. There are some notable
        controllers,  however, that I did not mention here that do need some
        recognition. Those being  the PLCs (programmable logic controllers),
        lighting controllers (dedicated  hardware), audio controllers (dedicated
        hardware), and prop controllers.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the PLCs,  lighting, and audio controllers. I left them out because they
        all require  specialized knowledge and can be a conversation for another
        blog post. They are  great for each use case but at the price of the units,
        and the knowledge  required to run them. I left them out of this initial
        blog. When it comes to  prop controllers, in my opinion they are overpriced
        for something that could be  made cheaper. If you are not technically
        inclined or just need a quick solution,  they are perfect. But at the price
        that most companies sell them for when you  can just make your own, why not?
    </p>

        Anyways,  that is all for this blog. Work hard, stay creative, stay curious.
