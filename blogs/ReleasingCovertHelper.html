<h1 class="center">Releasing the Covert Helper</h1>
    <h4>
        <p>
        Before we get started, I want to apologize for not posting last month. I recently started a full time job and have been busy working so I haven't had the time for
        the blog.
        </p> 
        <p>
        With that being said. I want to move this blog for the next couple months towards a development blog of my new project I am working on. The <a href="https://github.com/normotoryjazz/CovertHelper">Covert Helper</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
        I recently have been studying and preparing to take exams within the field of covert entry. And one thing I have been realizing over the time I have studied is that
        there are a lot of tools required for the job. You have your RFID and NFC sniffers (such as the proxmark). You have your lock picks. You have your key rings of common keys.
        You have wardriving. All these things that make recon and covert entry what it is. However finding a way to neatly and compactly use all your devices and tools can be messy.
        With most people just using a vest or bag of tools. But what if we could take all of the electronic tools, and make a modular device that has swappable modules so you can pick
        and choose what you need for your operation. Thats where the Covert Helper comes into play. An open-source project that allows the community to design there own modules for
        the Raspberry Pi with premade code that allows for easy installation and hot swapping.
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently, the first build is a dev build. And adds the ability for the Raspberry Pi to grab configs over OTG Serial from the Pi Zero W2. The future hope is for the project to be able
        to grab configs. Install libraries based on those configs. And setup both the host and client machine to work. All from one command line tool. 
        </p>
        If you are interested in the project, you can find it on github <a href="https://github.com/normotoryjazz/CovertHelper">here</a> and I stream on twitch every Wednesday at 6:00 PM CST <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/normotoryjazz">here</a>! <br>
        I will also be trying to get the development build done before DEF CON 33 and show it while I am at the con.
        <br>
        Again, sorry for not posting. And sorry for the shorter than normal blog post. Ill be working on it this Wednesday as always. And I hope to see you there. As always work hard, stay creative, stay curious.
