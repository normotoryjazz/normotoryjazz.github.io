<h1 class="center">Designing for Immersion - Show Don't Tell</h1>
    <h4>
        <p>
            When designing an immersive experience, there is a lot to take in. Balancing immersion, technology, puzzle design and creativity can be a difficult task.
            In this blog, I hope to share the solutions to some of these problems I have encountered while designing my own immersive experiences. As well as focus on
            the importance of "Show Don't Tell" or the process of showing an audience what they need to do rather than telling them.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what do I mean by "Show Don't Tell"? In the context of immersive design, "Show Don't Tell" means creating props, environments, and assets such as posters
            and logos. To tell a story. Think of it like this, with a book. The author has to tell you everything that is happening in the story. Depending on how
            the book is written, they may tell you what the bad guys are doing. As well as what the good guys are doing. This paints the story clear in your mind.
            However, when trying to immerse someone in an environment. Telling them exactly what is going on can break immersion. On make things feal unrealistic.
            This is why we use "Show Don't Tell". By creating props that have details in certain aspects. We can show the audience what is going on in the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, lets have the setting be a post-apocalyptic world. In this world, a virus has spread and caused our universe to be overrun by zombies.
            If we want to tell our audience that the zombies are a threat. We can use aspects like necrosis, blood, and other graphic details that would show the audience
            that the zombies are the threat of the universe. To bring this even further, we can create fake advertisements, news articles, and police reports. That talk about
            mysterious side effects of zombie bites. Again, we arent telling them the zombies are bad. Rather giving them the resources for the guest to come to that conclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is what "Show Don't Tell" is all about. Creating experiences using the mind. Not only does this create a puzzle on its own. But it allows the audience to get
            as involved as they want. They dont have to read the random street litter. But if they do, they can learn more about the universe. Another thing this allows us to do
            is give us a base line for our puzzles. No longer do we have to think of random puzzles that have no meaning. We can now create puzzles that add to our universe.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, why are we restarting that generator? Because this building has been abandoned for years and the power is out.
            Why are we looking for a key? Because the door to the building is locked and we need to get in before the zombies get us.
            This however, can also come with its challenges. If we are not careful, and a puzzle is out of place. It can break immersion.
            For example, if we are looking for a key to get into a building. But the key is locked behind a padlock that requires a code which is found in a book.
            This might not make sense. Why would the key be locked behind a padlock? Why would the code be in a book?
            How can we do this better? By using the "Show Don't Tell" method. Well the key is in a lockbox on a house with a for sale sign. The sign has a phone number on it.
            When dialing that number, it plays a voicemail explaining that the house is for sale and the code to the lockbox is 1234.
            Everything in your experience needs a reason to be there. If it does not, then it should not be there.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another problem that can come into play is the use of technology. If you use technology in your immersive expirience. It needs to make sense.
            In a post-apocalyptic world, their will not be a fancy brand new computer. It will be an old computer that has been used for years.
            In a post-apocalyptic world, there will not be a fancy brand new phone. It will be an old phone that has been used for years.
            You can use technology in your expirience. You just have to make it make sense. If your going to use RFID tags. Make sure that they arent seen as that.
            If your going to use a mag lock. Make that its hidden and there is a locking mechanism that makes sense.
            If your going to use a computer. Make sure that it is an old computer that has been used for years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, "Show Don't Tell" is powerful. One small detail can make or break your immersive experience.

            That is all for this blog. Work hard, stay creative, stay curious.
